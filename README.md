## ✨ Why LSM?

Group study coordination usually gets scattered across chat messages:

> “Who is there?” · “Is there still a seat?” · “When are you coming?” · “Are we focusing now?”

Learning Space Manager turns that noise into one live room. A **space** is a persistent study group with a stable six-character code. Each day, the first person on site opens the room, reserves tables, and lets everyone else claim a seat with an ETA.

      <h3>⏱️ Focus together</h3>
      Start a shared 45, 60, 90, custom-minute round — or one that ends at a set time, so breaks can be planned. Others can join during the opening window and every participant gets the break alert.

### Room and tables

- Tables are draggable, rotatable in 90° steps, and adjustable from one to eight seats.
- The room automatically frames the occupied layout while keeping space around the edges.
- Seats use solid colors for people who are present and outlined colors for people who are coming; free seats are outlined and labelled.
- Labels choose the fullest name that fits without shrinking the font, and add the arrival time underneath when the seat is big enough to hold it.
- Empty tables can be returned, reclaimed, or marked as taken by people outside the group.
- A session automatically expires after 28 hours, while its group and members remain available.

### Groups and people

- Accounts use a name, four-to-eight-digit PIN, and personal color.
- New registrations require a one-time admin invite; the first account and `ADMIN_USERNAME` can bootstrap access.
- Space codes and share links are permanent, even though the daily room is reset.
- The home screen shows people counts and free-seat availability for every active space.
- Tomorrow pledges give the next opener an early estimate of how many seats will be needed.
- Admins can book a seat in another member's name, or reserve for a guest attributed to any member.
- Colors are unique within a space: if yours is already taken when you join, you're given a random free one just for that space.

### Collaboration

- Poll options can be added by the group and ballots can be changed or withdrawn.
- Lunch votes include ETH Zentrum menus, closures, dish photos, and limited user suggestions.
- Shared focus rounds display every participant and send a single break notification when time is up.
- Session chat is readable by the space and writable by people holding a seat that day.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Requirements

- [Node.js 24](https://nodejs.org/) recommended
- npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelmrusch/lsm.git
cd lsm

npm install
npm --prefix web install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). The API runs on `http://localhost:3000`, and SQLite is created automatically at `data/lsm.sqlite`.

### Useful commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Run Express and Vite together with live reload |
| `npm run build` | Type-check and build the production frontend |
| `npm start` | Start Express and serve the frontend produced by `npm run build` |

<a id="docker-deployment"></a>

## 🐳 Docker deployment

The included Compose file runs the prebuilt image and persists all application data under `./data`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelmrusch/lsm.git
cd lsm
docker compose up -d
```

Every push to `main` builds `ghcr.io/michaelmrusch/lsm` with GitHub Actions and the repository's built-in token. Images are tagged both `latest` and with the commit SHA for easy rollbacks.

To update an existing installation:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

`pull_policy: always` fetches the newest image before recreating the service.

<details>
<summary><strong>Public access with Cloudflare Tunnel</strong></summary>

Point a Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnel at `http://localhost:3000`; Cloudflare can terminate HTTPS without a separate reverse proxy or certificate setup.

When `cloudflared` runs on the same machine, change the published port in `docker-compose.yml` to:

```yaml
ports:
  - "127.0.0.1:3000:3000"
```

That keeps the app reachable through the tunnel without exposing port `3000` publicly.

</details>

### Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Express HTTP port |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | SQLite database and generated VAPID keys |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | — | Grants the matching account access to `/admin` |
| `NAME_BLOCKLIST_FILE` | — | Optional absolute path to an extra name-policy JSON file; changes are picked up automatically |

### Name policy

New account names and guest reservations use the same case-insensitive name
policy. It normalizes punctuation, spacing, accents, common Unicode lookalikes
and leetspeak before checking a maintained English profanity dataset and the
local list in `server/name-blocklist.json`.

To add deployment-specific entries without rebuilding the image, set
`NAME_BLOCKLIST_FILE` to a mounted JSON file. It may contain any of these
optional arrays:

```json
{
  "blockedTerms": ["word blocked even inside a longer name"],
  "blockedNames": ["exact full name"],
  "allowedProfanityTerms": ["legitimate name exception"]
}
```

The external entries extend the built-in list and are reloaded when the file
changes. Existing accounts can still sign in after policy updates; the policy
applies when registering a new account or reserving a new guest.

## ✅ Verification

Build the production frontend before shipping a change:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production build type-checks the React frontend and emits the static bundle consumed by Express and the Docker image.
